/*
 * math_base.c - Math Base Implementation
 * 
 * Note: The small helper functions (vde_abs, vde_clamp, vde_isfinite, vde_approx)
 * are now implemented as static inline functions in math_base.h for better
 * performance and to avoid linking issues.
 * 
 * This file is kept as a placeholder for future non-inline math_base functionality.
